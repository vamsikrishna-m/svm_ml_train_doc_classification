polictics2.pdf,1,"National Politics: The Battle for a Country’s Future
National politics revolves around the governance of an entire country,
shaping its laws, economy, foreign relations, and social policies. It is the
most visible and consequential form of politics, often dominated by political
parties, elections, and ideological battles.
In democratic nations, national politics is structured around elections where
citizens choose representatives—presidents, prime ministers,
legislators—who then debate and enact laws. The ruling party or coalition
sets the national agenda, deciding policies on taxation, healthcare,
defense, education, and infrastructure. Opposition parties scrutinize the
government, propose alternatives, and mobilize public opinion.
However, national politics is not just about elections. It includes
bureaucratic governance, where civil servants implement policies, and
judicial politics, where courts interpret laws and sometimes overturn
government decisions. Media plays a crucial role as both a watchdog and a
shaper of public perception, influencing which issues gain national
attention.
In authoritarian systems, national politics is more centralized, with power
concentrated in the hands of a single leader, a military junta, or a dominant
party. Dissent is often suppressed, and political competition is restricted.
Yet, even in such systems, informal power struggles—between factions,
business elites, or regional leaders—can shape policy.
National politics is also deeply tied to geopolitics—how a country positions
itself in the world. Alliances, trade deals, wars, and diplomatic negotiations
all stem from the interplay of national interests and global power structures.",False,polictics
polictics6.pdf,1,"1. National Politics: The Theater of Power
National politics is the most visible and consequential form of governance,
determining the fate of millions. At this level, the struggle for control over a
country’s laws, economy, and identity unfolds through elections, legislation,
and sometimes revolutions.
Key Dynamics:
● Elections & Representation: In democracies, political parties
compete for votes, promising different visions for the nation.
Campaigns are battles of narratives—some based on ideology
(socialism vs. capitalism), others on identity (nationalism, religion,
ethnicity).
● Governing Institutions: The executive (president/prime minister),
legislature (parliament/congress), and judiciary (supreme courts)
constantly negotiate power. A strong leader may centralize authority,
while fragmented systems lead to coalition politics.
● Media & Public Opinion: News outlets, social media, and
propaganda shape what people believe. Politicians manipulate
narratives, while investigative journalism holds power accountable.
● Geopolitics: No nation exists in isolation. Trade wars, military
alliances (NATO), and global institutions (UN, WTO) dictate how
countries interact. A single diplomatic misstep can trigger economic
collapse or war.
Real-World Examples:
● Populism vs. Technocracy: Leaders like Donald Trump (U.S.) and
Narendra Modi (India) use emotional appeals, while others (like
Germany’s Angela Merkel) govern through pragmatism.
● Authoritarian Resilience: China’s Communist Party blends
capitalism with repression, while Russia’s Putin uses oligarchic
control and misinformation to stay in power.",False,polictics
polictics6.pdf,2,,True,polictics
polictics8.pdf,1,"Beyond government, politics thrives in colleges and universities, where
students and professors clash over ideas, funding, and institutional control.
Student elections mirror national politics, complete with campaigns,
scandals, and ideological battles. Activists push for reforms—whether on
tuition costs, free speech, or social justice—while administrators balance
budgets and donor interests. Faculty politics, though less visible, can be
just as intense, with professors jockeying for promotions, research grants,
and influence over academic policies.
Even in the workplace, office politics dictates who rises, who falls, and
who gets heard. Formal job titles matter, but so do informal alliances,
gossip, and the subtle art of managing perceptions. A well-connected
employee might outmaneuver a more qualified rival. A boss’s favoritism can
shape careers just as much as hard work. Some workplaces foster
collaboration, while others become toxic arenas of backstabbing and power
plays.
Underlying all these layers is the psychology of power—why some
people seek it, how they keep it, and what they’re willing to do to avoid
losing it. Some leaders govern with vision and empathy; others rule through
fear and division. Corruption, betrayal, and hypocrisy are as much a part of
politics as idealism and reform.
Yet despite its flaws, politics remains essential. It’s how societies resolve
conflicts, distribute resources, and adapt to change. Without politics, there
would be only chaos or tyranny. The question is not whether politics exists,
but what kind of politics we choose to create—one that serves the many
or exploits the few, one that builds or destroys.
In the end, politics is not just about laws and governments. It’s about
us—our hopes, fears, and endless struggle to shape the world around us.
Whether in a voting booth, a boardroom, or a classroom, we are all part of
the game. The only choice is whether to play blindly or to play wisely.",False,polictics

polictics4.pdf,1,"College Politics: The Microcosm of Power Struggles
College politics may seem small in scale, but it mirrors the broader political
world in surprising ways. Student unions, faculty committees, and
administrative decisions all involve negotiation, alliances, and sometimes
intense rivalries.
Student elections are a key feature in many universities, where candidates
campaign on issues like tuition fees, campus facilities, and academic
freedom. Political parties (both national and ideological) often back student
groups, turning campuses into battlegrounds for larger societal debates.
Protests over fee hikes, curriculum changes, or social justice issues
frequently emerge from student politics.
Faculty politics, on the other hand, involves tenure battles, departmental
funding, and academic influence. Professors compete for research grants,
administrative positions, and control over academic policies. University
senates or boards make high-level decisions that affect the entire
institution, often balancing between government regulations, donor
interests, and student demands.
Cliques, favoritism, and power struggles exist here just as they do in
national politics. A dean’s leadership style might resemble that of a political
leader—sometimes democratic, sometimes authoritarian. Meanwhile,
student activists may experience their first taste of realpolitik: learning how
to mobilize support, negotiate with authorities, and sometimes face
repression.",False,polictics
polictics3.pdf,1,"State/Regional Politics: The Power Closer to Home
While national politics deals with the big picture, state or regional politics (in
federal systems like the U.S., India, or Germany) focuses on governance at
a smaller scale. States or provinces have their own legislatures, chief
ministers or governors, and administrative systems that handle local issues
like education, policing, and transportation.
State politics often revolves around regional identity, resource allocation,
and autonomy debates. Some states have distinct cultural or linguistic
identities that influence their political demands—such as Quebec in
Canada or Catalonia in Spain. Regional parties sometimes emerge,
advocating for greater state rights or even secession.
In many countries, state governments act as testing grounds for national
policies. For example, a healthcare or education reform might first be
implemented in a state before being adopted nationwide. Conversely,
conflicts between state and central governments can arise—especially
when different political parties control each level.
State politics also involves local power brokers—business leaders, caste or
clan networks, and influential families—who can sway elections and policy
decisions. Corruption and patronage systems often thrive at this level,
where personal connections sometimes matter more than formal
institutions.",False,polictics
polictics5.pdf,1,"Office Politics: The Unwritten Rules of Workplace Power
Every workplace, whether a corporate firm, a government agency, or a
small business, has its own political ecosystem. Office politics refers to the
informal power structures, alliances, and rivalries that influence decisions,
promotions, and workplace culture.
Unlike formal hierarchies (where job titles define authority), office politics
operates through relationships. A mid-level employee who has the boss’s
ear may wield more influence than a higher-ranked manager who is out of
favor. Networking, loyalty, and perception management often matter as
much as—or more than—competence.
Key elements of office politics include:
● Alliances & Factions: Colleagues form groups to support each
other’s agendas.
● Gossip & Reputation: Rumors can build or destroy careers.
● Power Plays: Subtle moves like taking credit for others’ work or
sidelining rivals.
● Leadership Dynamics: A CEO’s management style can create
either a collaborative or toxic culture.
Those who navigate office politics well advance faster, while those who
ignore it may find themselves sidelined. Ethical dilemmas arise when
politics leads to favoritism, discrimination, or unethical behavior. Some
workplaces try to minimize office politics through transparency, while others
thrive (or suffer) because of it.",False,polictics
polictics7.pdf,1,"Politics is the invisible force that shapes every aspect of human society,
from the grand stage of international diplomacy to the quiet power struggles
in a neighborhood association. At its core, politics is about who gets what,
who holds power, and how decisions are made—whether through
cooperation, competition, or outright conflict. It is the art of governing, but
also the science of human behavior, reflecting our deepest desires for
control, security, and belonging.
At the highest level, national politics determines the fate of entire
countries. Governments rise and fall through elections, revolutions, or
coups, each promising a better future while grappling with the realities of
power. Leaders must balance competing interests—wealthy elites, the
working class, ethnic groups, and global allies—while navigating crises like
economic downturns, wars, and pandemics. Political parties battle for
votes, using ideology, charisma, and sometimes fear to win public support.
Meanwhile, bureaucracies and courts shape policy behind the scenes,
often resisting or enabling the whims of those in charge.
Zooming in, state and regional politics reveal how power operates closer
to home. Local leaders—governors, mayors, council members—deal with
the daily concerns of their people: schools, roads, policing, and jobs. But
even here, politics is rarely just about policy. Regional identities, historical
grievances, and personal rivalries shape decisions. In some places, politics
is a family business, with dynasties passing power from one generation to
the next. In others, grassroots movements rise up to challenge the status
quo, demanding change through protests or elections.",False,polictics

authority, the creation of laws, and the distribution of resources within a
community, whether at the local, national, or international level. At its core,
politics is about who gets what, when, and how—shaping the rules and
structures that define our lives.
Political systems vary widely, from democracies where power is
theoretically held by the people, to autocracies where authority is
concentrated in the hands of a single ruler or elite. Ideologies like
liberalism, conservatism, socialism, and nationalism influence how
societies are organized and governed. Political institutions—such as
parliaments, courts, and executive offices—structure decision-making,
while political parties, interest groups, and media shape public opinion and
policy debates.
Beyond domestic governance, politics extends to international relations,
where nations negotiate trade, form alliances, and sometimes engage in
conflict. Organizations like the United Nations and the World Trade
Organization play roles in mediating global disputes and cooperation.
However, politics is often criticized for corruption, inefficiency, and division.
Leaders may prioritize power over public good, and partisan conflicts can
hinder progress. Yet, despite its flaws, politics remains essential for

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the process of making machine intelligent and capable to do works
humans do. It is a technique in which a machine becomes intelligent after experience at some
work. It is a booming field in present time as it can be used to automate works humans do.
Supervised Learning is a technique in AI in which the data is labelled and the data is either done
classification or regression task. The model is trained until it can detect the underlying patterns
and relationships between the input data and the output labels, enabling it to yield accurate
labeling results when presented with never-before-seen data. Supervised learning is good at
classification and regression problems, such as determining what category a news article
belongs to or predicting the volume of sales for a given future date. In supervised learning, the
aim is to make sense of data within the context of a specific question.
In contrast to supervised learning is unsupervised learning. In this approach, the algorithm is
presented with unlabeled data and is designed to detect patterns or similarities on its own. It
can be done by different clustering algorithms.
The chief difference between unsupervised and supervised learning is in how the algorithm
learns. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given unlabeled data as a training set. Unlike
in supervised learning, there are no correct output values; the algorithm determines the
patterns and similarities within the data, as opposed to relating it to some external
measurement. In other words, algorithms are able to function freely in order to learn more
about the data and find interesting or unexpected findings that human beings weren't looking
for. Unsupervised learning is popular in applications of clustering (the act of uncovering groups
within data) and association (the act of predicting rules that describe the data).

How does AI work?
As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to
promote how their products and services use AI. Often what they refer to as
AI is simply one component of AI, such as machine learning. AI requires a
foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training
machine learning algorithms. No one programming language is
synonymous with AI, but a few, including Python, R and Java, are popular.
In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training
data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these
patterns to make predictions about future states. In this way, a chatbot that
is fed examples of text chats can learn to produce lifelike exchanges with
people, or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe
objects in images by reviewing millions of examples.
AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and
self-correction.
Learning processes. This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring
data and creating rules for how to turn the data into actionable

Within artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, there are two basic
approaches: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. The main
difference is one uses labeled data to help predict outcomes, while the",False,AI
KCE075BCT006_AI.pdf,2,"other does not. However, there are some nuances between the two
approaches, and key areas in which one outperforms the other. This post
will clarify the differences so you can choose the best approach for your
situation.
What is supervised learning?
Supervised learning is a machine learning approach that’s defined by its use
of labeled datasets. These datasets are designed to train or “supervise”
algorithms into classifying data or predicting outcomes accurately. Using
labeled inputs and outputs, the model can measure its accuracy and learn
over time.
Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems
when data mining: classification and regression:
Classification problems use an algorithm to accurately assign test
•
data into specific categories, such as separating apples from oranges.
Or, in the real world, supervised learning algorithms can be used to
classify spam in a separate folder from your inbox. Linear classifiers,
support vector machines, decision trees and random forest are all
common types of classification algorithms.
Regression is another type of supervised learning method that uses
•
an algorithm to understand the relationship between dependent and
independent variables. Regression models are helpful for predicting
numerical values based on different data points, such as sales revenue
projections for a given business. Some popular regression algorithms
are linear regression, logistic regression and polynomial regression.
What is unsupervised learning?
Unsupervised learning uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and
cluster unlabeled data sets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns in
data without the need for human intervention (hence, they are
“unsupervised”).",False,AI
KCE075BCT006_AI.pdf,3,"Unsupervised learning models are used for three main tasks: clustering,
association and dimensionality reduction:
Clustering is a data mining technique for grouping unlabeled data
•
based on their similarities or differences. For example, K-means
clustering algorithms assign similar data points into groups, where
the K value represents the size of the grouping and granularity. This
technique is helpful for market segmentation, image compression,
etc.
Association is another type of unsupervised learning method that
•
uses different rules to find relationships between variables in a given
dataset. These methods are frequently used for market basket
analysis and recommendation engines, along the lines of “Customers
Who Bought This Item Also Bought” recommendations.
Dimensionality reduction is a learning technique used when the
•
number of features (or dimensions) in a given dataset is too high. It
reduces the number of data inputs to a manageable size while also
preserving the data integrity. Often, this technique is used in the
preprocessing data stage, such as when autoencoders remove noise
from visual data to improve picture quality.
The main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning:
Labeled data
The main distinction between the two approaches is the use of labeled
datasets. To put it simply, supervised learning uses labeled input and
output data, while an unsupervised learning algorithm does not.
In supervised learning, the algorithm “learns” from the training dataset by
iteratively making predictions on the data and adjusting for the correct
answer. While supervised learning models tend to be more accurate than
unsupervised learning models, they require upfront human intervention to
label the data appropriately. For example, a supervised learning model can
predict how long your commute will be based on the time of day, weather
conditions and so on. But first, you’ll have to train it to know that rainy
weather extends the driving time.",False,AI
KCE075BCT006_AI.pdf,4,"Unsupervised learning models, in contrast, work on their own to discover
the inherent structure of unlabeled data. Note that they still require some
human intervention for validating output variables. For example, an
unsupervised learning model can identify that online shoppers often
purchase groups of products at the same time. However, a data analyst
would need to validate that it makes sense for a recommendation engine to
group baby clothes with an order of diapers, applesauce and sippy cups.
Other key differences between supervised and unsupervised learning
Goals: In supervised learning, the goal is to predict outcomes for new
•
data. You know up front the type of results to expect. With an
unsupervised learning algorithm, the goal is to get insights from large
volumes of new data. The machine learning itself determines what is
different or interesting from the dataset.
Applications: Supervised learning models are ideal for spam
•
detection, sentiment analysis, weather forecasting and pricing
predictions, among other things. In contrast, unsupervised learning is
a great fit for anomaly detection, recommendation engines, customer
personas and medical imaging.
Complexity: Supervised learning is a simple method for machine
•
learning, typically calculated through the use of programs like R or
Python. In unsupervised learning, you need powerful tools for
working with large amounts of unclassified data. Unsupervised
learning models are computationally complex because they need a
large training set to produce intended outcomes.
Drawbacks: Supervised learning models can be time-consuming to
•
train, and the labels for input and output variables require expertise.
Meanwhile, unsupervised learning methods can have wildly
inaccurate results unless you have human intervention to validate the
output variables.",False,AI

1 Introduction
Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by ma-
chines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert
systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.
2 How does AI work?
As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to pro-
mote how their products and services use AI. Often what they refer to as AI is
simplyonecomponentofAI,suchasmachinelearning. AIrequiresafoundation
of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning
algorithms. No one programming language is synonymous with AI, but a few,
including Python, R and Java, are popular.
In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training
data, analyzingthedataforcorrelationsandpatterns, andusingthesepatterns
to make predictions about future states. In this way, a chatbot that is fed
examples of text chats can learn to produce lifelike exchanges with people, or
an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images
by reviewing millions of examples.
AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and
self-correction.
processes: This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and
creating rules for how to turn the data into actionable information. The rules,
which are called algorithms, provide computing devices with step-by-step in-
structions for how to complete a specific task.
Reasoning processes: This aspect of AI programming focuses on choosing
the right algorithm to reach a desired outcome.

Artificial intelligence is the intelligence possessed and demonstrated by machines. AI is the simulation
of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. AI
can also be applied to any machine that displays the traits applied to human mind such as learning and
problem solving. AI is the ability of the machines to perform certain tasks that require intelligence when
done by humans and animals. A computer is said to have AI if it can think humanly, act humanly, think
rationally and act rationally. The term AI was first coined by Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy in 1950s
who are known as fathers of AI. AI is a large field which composes of machine learning and deep
learning. The most common applications of AI are robots, voice assistants, chat bots, recommendation
systems, prediction systems, classification systems, search engines, games etc.
Machine Learning
Machine learning is one of the most promising approaches to AI. It allows system to perform certain
tasks by learning from past data instead of being explicitly programmed. In ML, A computer program is
said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if it
performs tasks in T, as measured by P and improves with E. Components of Machine learning includes
Data, model, learning and application.
Types of Machine Learning:
1) Supervised Machine Learning
In supervised learning, you pass the samples containing the input features and their desired
outputs to the machine learning model for training. The model then learns a mapping from the
input features to the desired output. You aim to produce an accurate enough mapping so that
the algorithm can predict the output as correctly as possible whenever a new test input is given.
As the desired output passed during the training supervises the model to learn the required
mapping, this learning method is called supervised learning
2) Unsupervised Machine Learning:
As opposed to supervised learning, in unsupervised learning, you pass the samples containing
only the input features to the machine learning model. The model then extracts different useful
features and patterns from the data. As the desired output is no longer supervising the learning
process, this learning method is called unsupervised learning.
3) Reinforcement Learning:
Reinforcement Learning is the type of machine learning where the machine learns on its own
using observations gathered from the interaction with its environment to take actions that
would maximize the reward or minimize the risk.",False,AI
KCE075BCT028_AI.pdf,1,"About AI:
Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural
intelligence displayed by animals including humans. AI research has been defined as the field of study
of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that
maximize its chance of achieving its goals. The term ""artificial intelligence"" had previously been used to
describe machines that mimic and display ""human"" cognitive skills that are associated with the human
mind, such as ""learning"" and ""problem-solving"". This definition has since been rejected by major AI
researchers who now describe AI in terms of rationality and acting rationally, which does not limit how
intelligence can be articulated.
Supervised learning, as the name indicates, has the presence of a supervisor as a teacher.
Basically supervised learning is when we teach or train the machine using data that is well labelled.
Which means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. After that, the machine is provided
with a new set of examples(data) so that the supervised learning algorithm analyses the training data(set
of training examples) and produces a correct outcome from labelled data. Unsupervised learning is the
training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm
to act on that information without guidance. Here the task of the machine is to group unsorted
information according to similarities, patterns, and differences without any prior training of data.
Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input/output pairs be
presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is on
finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).
Machine learning is how AI technology learns and gets smarter on its own.In machine learning, a human
trains a machine to achieve an outcome, using data prepared by the human. Using what it learned from the
human, the machine then goes and tries to achieve the outcome using data it's never seen before. Every
time the machine tries to achieve the outcome, it learns from the results—even if they're bad. And it
applies these learnings to its next attempt. In this way, the machine uses machine learning to rapidly
improve at a task without direct human involvement. Pattern recognition is when machines detect pattens
in data. These patterns help machines better optimize towards outcomes, which makes pattern recognition
a key function in machine learning. Pattern recognition is also what powers AI's predictive capabilities. A
machine uses patterns in historical data to predict which future outcomes are most likely. Natural
language generation is when AI writes or speaks human-sounding language. Natural language
generation powers everything from writing tools to smart home assistants to chatbots. It makes it possible
to converse with machines. Natural language processing is when AI interprets what human language
means. To do NLG, a machine must use natural language processing to first understand written or spoken
language. For instance, Google Translate uses NLP to understand the text you type, then generate its
translation in whatever language you select.
Image recognition is when AI accurately identifies objects in photos. Using machine learning, AI
systems can identify objects in images with a high degree of accuracy. The AI system is trained on
millions or billions of images to detect certain objects. Trained well, it can then go and recognize those",False,AI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming our world. Remarkable surges in AI capabilities have
led to a wide range of innovations including autonomous vehicles and connected Internet of Things
devices in our homes. AI is even contributing to the development of a brain-controlled robotic arm that
can help a paralyzed person feel again through complex direct human-brain interfaces. These new AI-
enabled systems are revolutionizing and benefitting nearly all aspects of our society and economy –
everything from commerce and healthcare to transportation and cyber security. But the development
and use of the new technologies it brings are not without technical challenges and risks. AI and
Machine Learning (ML) is changing the way in which society addresses economic and national
security challenges and opportunities. It is being used in genomics, image and video processing,
materials, natural language processing, robotics, wireless spectrum monitoring and more. These
technologies must be developed and used in a trustworthy and responsible manner.
Algorithm
An algorithm is a formula representing the relationship between certain variables. Think of algorithms
as a simple set of instructions with a finite end designed to produce an output. An everyday example
of an algorithm is a recipe. You have a set amount of inputs (ingredients) designed to produce a
repeatable output — apple pie, for example. Machine learning programs in AI use algorithms to make
predictions, and in the case of marketing, suggestions are based on algorithms that hope to target the
user’s specific preferences (if website visitor ‘A’ visits pages for kid’s short sleeve shirts an algorithm
will email them coupons for kid’s short sleeve shirts).
Chatbots
A chatbot is a program that runs within websites and apps that interacts directly with users to help
them with simple tasks. A “conversation” happens between the user and the computer program. These
are often currently used for customer support, but the applications for chatbots are growing.
Cluster
Any group of people or things that share a common characteristic. Data is combed through by AI to
uncover patterns and connections that humans might not readily see. Clusters can be used to identify
target segments or audiences, creating marketing opportunities through commonalities.
Cognitive science
The broader form of study that includes AI in addition to philosophy, linguistics, psychology,
neuroscience, and anthropology. All of these combine together to learn how the mind functions and,
when applied to AI, how machines can simulate human thought and action.
Machine learning
With limited need for programming, machines can teach themselves. Combing through massive
amounts of data allows AI to identify patterns and groupings. This could be used to determine target
audiences, decide on optimal times to send emails, or segment out groupings for deeper engagement.
Deep learning
In this advanced version of machine learning, computers actually teach themselves with minimal
programming by humans. Marketers can use deep learning to identify data and make predictions
related to how consumers might behave.
Image recognition (or “computer vision”)
One of the more complicated processes for machine learning, computers can be programmed to
understand what is happening in an image. AI searches for patterns within images to quickly identify
nuances that humans may not see.
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
This technology allows machines to determine what humans are saying, whether in text or by voice.",False,AI

actual vocabulary, but also pulling out context and more hidden meanings. Sarcasm and subtlety are

Neural networks
Structured to be similar to the human brain, this AI model incorporates natural language processing
and deep learning to identify faces in photos and analyze handwriting.
Semantic analysis
A more sophisticated form of Natural Language Processing, this concept is focused on the process of
stringing words together as well as the way that language is understood through cultural context. This
could function as a help to create eBooks and blog posts, with the potential to replace human writers
or content marketers (!). Wait, what?
TensorFlow™ is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs.
Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the
multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows
you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a
single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google
Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting
machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be
applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.
PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework based on the Torch library, used for
applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily developed by Meta
AI. It is free and open-source software released under the Modified BSD license. Although
the Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of development, PyTorch also has
a C++ interface.
MindSpore is the AI computing framework. Fully developed by Huawei from the ground up, it
implements on-demand collaboration across the cloud-edge-device. It provides unified APIs and end-
to-end AI capabilities for model development, execution, and deployment in all scenarios.
Using a distributed architecture, MindSpore leverages a native differentiable programming paradigm
and new AI native execution modes to achieve better resource efficiency, security, and
trustworthiness. Meanwhile, MindSpore makes full use of the computing power of Ascend AI
processors and lowers the entry requirements of industry AI development, bringing inclusive AI faster

Supervised learning is an approach to creating artificial intelligence (AI), where a computer algorithm is
trained on input data that has been labeled for a particular output. The model is trained until it can
detect the underlying patterns and relationships between the input data and the output labels, enabling
it to yield accurate labeling results when presented with never-before-seen data.
Supervised learning is good at classification and regression problems, such as determining what
category a news article belongs to or predicting the volume of sales for a given future date. In
supervised learning, the aim is to make sense of data within the context of a specific question.
Unsupervised Learning is a machine learning technique in which the users do not need to supervise
the model. Instead, it allows the model to work on its own to discover patterns and information that
was previously undetected. It mainly deals with the unlabelled data.

analyses the training data(set of training examples) and produces a correct outcome from labelled
data.
Unsupervised learning
Unsupervised learning is the training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor
labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. Here the task of
the machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns, and differences
without any prior training of data.
Unlike supervised learning, no teacher is provided that means no training will be given to the
machine. Therefore the machine is restricted to find the hidden structure in unlabeled data by
itself.

The website development process defines the functionality, applicability, and general functioning of your
website. A user-friendly user interface on a website will result in a considerably greater conversion rate,
which will translate into more business and profits. This is accomplished through the use of exceptional web
design on a developer's website. Optimization of the website to increase its search engine presence will
guide this decision-making process. Web design enables you to build and maintain consistency across all
sections of your website, which is important for SEO.
The company owner can select the photographs that will be used by contacting a competent web designer.
SEO is a critical component of the web building process that must be handled with attention. Through this
optimization, the website appears when different searches are entered into the search engine. This means
the website receives more hits from search engine results pages and increases its visibility. The amount of
money a business makes is directly proportional to the volume of sales it produces.
The creation and effective promotion of a website may help a business attract more customers and increase
sales. According to the research, eCommerce operations climbed by 21.3 percent in the previous calendar
year. A well-designed website is essential for reaching a larger audience and generating more leads or
customers. A pleasant user experience and an easy-to-understand website design will encourage customers
to spend more time on your website and learn more about the products and services you provide. Web

The Web is the common name for the World Wide Web, a subset of the Internet consisting of the pages
that can be accessed by a Web browser. Many people assume that the Web is the same as the Internet,
and use these terms interchangeably. However, the term Internet actually refers to the global network of
servers that makes the information sharing that happens over the Web possible. So, although the Web
does make up a large portion of the Internet, but they are not one and same.
Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or
an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static
page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A
more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web
engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting,
Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
Website development is a way to make people aware of the services and/or products you are offering,
understand why your products are relevant and even necessary for them to buy or use, and see which of
your company's qualities set it apart from competitors. Displaying this information with high-quality
images and thought-out presentation will have a large influence on customers, and it is important to
strive towards making your product as relatable and appealing as possible. Additionally, with website
development you can:
1. Communicate with your visitors effectively. Interacting with your audience is vital when it comes to
generating more business. It is viable to make a website that enables you to get in touch with your
customers and prospects, and you can produce valuable content for the audience associated with the
industry or business you're in. Afterwards, post the content on your blog, share it on social media
networks and respond to customers' comments and feedback promptly. This will show your clients the
extent to which you’re concerned about their satisfaction and responsive to their needs.
2. Improve your connectivity. A website will facilitate things like expanding your reach and attracting
more visitors to your business. Planning to make a responsive website design for your site will help
make it accessible to an extensive range of users spanning several devices, such as tablets or
smartphones. This will increase both your site's exposure and organic traffic.
3. Prove your reliability. A website offers a straightforward method of showing the credibility of a
business, and the way a person represents his business online is vital for attracting more customers or
visitors. Therefore, your website design should be handled in the best possible way, because a
professional presentation speaks volumes as testimony to your business. With the help of website
development, you can add your skills, credentials, experience, expertise and more in a single place.

Front End and Back End: Frontend and Backend are the two most popular terms used in web
development. These terms are very crucial for web development but are quite different from each other.
Each side needs to communicate and operate effectively with the other as a single unit to improve the
website’s functionality.
Front End Development: The part of a website that the user interacts with directly is termed the front
end. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application. It includes everything that users
experience directly: text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, colors, and navigation
menu. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the languages used for Front End development. The structure,
design, behavior, and content of everything seen on browser screens when websites, web applications,
or mobile apps are opened up, is implemented by front End developers. Responsiveness and
performance are two main objectives of the Front End. The developer must ensure that the site is
responsive i.e. it appears correctly on devices of all sizes no part of the website should behave
abnormally irrespective of the size of the screen.
Front end Languages: The front end portion is built by using some languages which are discussed
below:
HTML: HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to design the front-end portion of
web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language.
Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. The markup language is used to define the text
documentation within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to
simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages.
More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.
JavaScript: JavaScript is a famous scripting language used to create magic on the sites to make the site
interactive for the user. It is used to enhancing the functionality of a website to running cool games and
web-based software.
There are many other languages through which one can do front-end development depending upon the
framework for example Flutter user Dart, React uses JavaScript and Django uses Python, and much
more.
Front End Frameworks and Libraries:
AngularJS: AngularJs is a JavaScript open-source front-end framework that is mainly used to develop
single-page web applications(SPAs). It is a continuously growing and expanding framework which
provides better ways for developing web applications. It changes the static HTML to dynamic HTML.
It is an open-source project which can be free. It extends HTML attributes with Directives, and data is
bound with HTML.

the application. It is maintained by Facebook.",False,WEB
KCE075BCT045_WEB.pdf,3,"Bootstrap: Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web
applications. It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive,

jQuery: jQuery is an open-source JavaScript library that simplifies the interactions between an
HTML/CSS document, or more precisely the Document Object Model (DOM), and JavaScript.
Elaborating the terms, jQuery simplifies HTML document traversing and manipulation, browser event
handling, DOM animations, Ajax interactions, and cross-browser JavaScript development.
SASS: It is the most reliable, mature, and robust CSS extension language. It is used to extend the
functionality of an existing CSS of a site including everything from variables, inheritance, and nesting
with ease.
Flutter: Flutter is an open-source UI development SDK managed by google. It is powered by Dart
programming language. It builds performant and good-looking natively compiled applications for
mobile (Ios, Android), web, and desktop from a single code base. The key selling point of flutter is flat
development is made easier, expressive, and flexible UI and native performance. In march 2021 flutter
announce Flutter 2 which upgrades flutter to build release applications for the web, and the desktop is
in beta state.
Some other libraries and frameworks are Semantic-UI, Foundation, Materialize, Backbone.js, Ember.js,
etc.
Backend Development: Backend is the server-side of the website. It stores and arranges data, and also
makes sure everything on the client-side of the website works fine. It is the part of the website that you
cannot see and interact with. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the
users. The parts and characteristics developed by backend designers are indirectly accessed by users

Back end Languages: The back end portion is built by using some languages which are discussed
below:
PHP: PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. Since PHP
code executed on the server-side, so it is called a server-side scripting language.
C++: It is a general-purpose programming language and widely used nowadays for competitive
programming. It is also used as a backend language.
Java: Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages and platforms. It is
highly scalable. Java components are easily available.
Python: Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more
efficiently.
Node.js: Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript
code outside a browser. You need to remember that NodeJS is not a framework, and it’s not a
programming language. Most people are confused and understand it’s a framework or a programming
language. We often use Node.js for building back-end services like APIs like Web App or Mobile App.
It’s used in production by large companies such as Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart, and so on.

Watson LLC (Elementary Watson) for an exemption from §§ 61.3(a)(1)(i), 91.7(a),
91.119(c), 91.121, 91.151(b), 91.403(b), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1),
91.409(a)(2), 91.417(a), 91.417(b), 137.19(c), 137.19(d), 137.19(e)(2)(ii),
137.19(e)(2)(iii), 137.19(e)(2)(v), 137.31(a), 137.31(b), 137.33(a), 137.33(b), 137.41(c),
and 137.42 of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) to the extent necessary to
allow Elementary Watson to operate unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), weighing
55 pounds (lbs.) or greater, for the provision of commercial agricultural-related services.
Additional Relief Determined to be Necessary
The FAA finds relief from 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a)(2), and 61.3(c)(1) is necessary. The FAA
evaluated Elementary Watson’s operation, which includes controlled-access locations,
AFS-24-02305-E",False,WEB
FAA-2024-0545-0004_attachment_1.pdf,4,"2
speed limitations, and low-altitude operating environment, and finds these characteristics
are adequate mitigations in the event of a medical incident. Therefore, the FAA has
determined that requiring a third-class medical certificate provides reasonable assurance
that the pilot does not have any physical or mental condition that would interfere with the
safe operation of the UAS, and relief is granted to 14 CFR §§ 61.23(a)(2) and 61.3(c)(1).
The FAA finds that relief from 14 CFR § 91.209(a)(1) is necessary for nighttime
operations. The FAA finds that the UA does not need to be equipped with position lights
since the UA is equipped with identification lights. As the UA is equipped with
identification lights instead of position lights, relief from 14 CFR § 91.209(a)(1) is
granted. Refer to Condition and Limitation No. 16.
Airworthiness
The UAS on the List of Approved UAS (Agricultural) under Section 44807, found at
Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2023-1271, do not currently have an airworthiness
certificate. In accordance with the statutory criteria provided in 49 U.S.C. § 44807, and in
consideration of the size, weight, speed, and operational capability, proximity to airports
and populated areas, and specific operations, a determination has been made that the
aircraft do not create a hazard to users of the National Airspace System (NAS) or the
public.
Elementary Watson is approved to operate any UAS under this exemption that has been
approved for agricultural operations. This list, along with the approved maximum takeoff
weight (MTOW), which includes the payload weight, can be found on the List of
Approved Unmanned Aircraft Systems under Section 44807. The list, which will be
updated periodically, is posted at www.regulations.gov, under
Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2023-1271. This list is for UAS weighing 55 pounds (lbs.)
or greater including payload that are unable to fly under part 107 due to the MTOW of
the aircraft.
Materially Similar Decisions
The FAA has issued grants of exemption in circumstances similar in all material respects
to those presented in your petition. In Grant of Exemption Nos. 18009, 18413A,
19037B1, and 22003, the FAA found that a grant of exemption was in the public interest,
that the proposed operations’ UAS safety features and the limitations under which the
Exemption Holder would operate were sufficient mitigations that ensured the proposed
agricultural operations would not adversely affect safety, and that the Exemption Holder
1 All of these exemptions are available for review on the Regulatory Docket at www.regulations.gov,
Exemption No. 18009 is available at Document ID No. FAA-2018-0574-0009, Exemption No. 18413A is
available at Document ID No. FAA-2019-0802-0012, Exemption No. 19037B is available at Document ID
No. FAA-2022-0034-0007, and Exemption No. 22003 is available at Document ID No. FAA-2023-1833.

may operate any UAS for these operations that has been previously approved by the
Secretary.
Having reviewed your reasons for requesting an exemption, I find that:
• They are similar in all material respects to relief previously requested in Grant of
Exemption Nos. 18009, 18413A, 19037B, and 22003;
• The reasons stated by the FAA for granting Exemption Nos. 18009, 18413A, 19037B,
and 22003 also apply to the situation presented in your petition; and
• A grant of exemption is in the public interest.
The FAA’s Decision
The FAA has determined that good cause exists for not publishing a summary of the
petition in the Federal Register because the requested exemption would not set a
precedent, and any delay in acting on this petition would be detrimental to Elementary
Watson.
Under the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. §§ 106(f), 40113, 44701, and 44807, which
the FAA Administrator has delegated to me, I hereby grant Elementary Watson LLC an
exemption from 14 CFR §§ 61.3(a)(1)(i), 61.3(c)(1), 61.23(a)(2), 91.7(a), 91.119(c),
91.121, 91.151(b), 91.209(a)(1), 91.403(b), 91.405(a), 91.407(a)(1), 91.409(a)(1),
91.409(a)(2), 91.417(a), 91.417(b), 137.19(c), 137.19(d), 137.19(e)(2)(ii),
137.19(e)(2)(iii), 137.19(e)(2)(v), 137.31(a), 137.31(b), 137.33(a), 137.33(b), 137.41(c),
and 137.42 to the extent necessary to allow Elementary Watson to operate any UAS
found on the List of Approved Agricultural UAS under Section 44807 for the provision
of commercial agricultural-related services, subject to the conditions and limitations
described below.
Conditions and Limitations
1. This exemption is non-transferable. Only Elementary Watson LLC may conduct
operations in accordance with this exemption.
2. Elementary Watson must obtain an agricultural aircraft operator certificate under
part 137 by submitting FAA Form 8710-3 (copy enclosed) and Elementary Watson’s
exemption number to UAS137Certificates@faa.gov. Please note, the name of person
or entity on the 8710-3 application must match the Exemption Holder’s name.
3. Prior to operations under 14 CFR part 137, consistent with Conditions and
Limitations Nos. 27 and 29 below, Elementary Watson may conduct non-commercial
training flights, proficiency flights, experience-building flights, and maintenance
AFS-24-02305-E",False,WEB
FAA-2024-0545-0004_attachment_1.pdf,6,"4
functional test flights all limited to employees under this exemption with the
understanding that Elementary Watson is conducting these flights for the purpose of
obtaining their part 137 agricultural aircraft operator certificate.
4. Operations authorized by this grant of exemption include any unmanned aircraft
system (UAS), along with the approved maximum take-off weight (MTOW), which
includes payload, for the respective UAS identified on the List of Approved UAS
(Agricultural) under Section 44807 at Regulatory Docket No. FAA-2023-1271 at
www.regulations.gov, when weighing 55 pounds (lbs.) or greater including payload.
Proposed operations of any aircraft not on the list, or at different weights than
currently approved, will require a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.
5. This exemption does not excuse Elementary Watson from complying with
14 CFR part 375. If operations under this exemption involve the use of foreign civil
aircraft, Elementary Watson must obtain a Foreign Aircraft Permit pursuant to
14 CFR § 375.41 before conducting any operations under this exemption. Application
instructions are specified in 14 CFR § 375.43.
6. The unmanned aircraft (UA) may not be operated at a groundspeed exceeding
30 miles per hour or at a speed greater than the maximum operating speed
recommended by the aircraft manufacturer, whichever is lower.
7. All operations must be conducted in accordance with an Air Traffic Organization
(ATO) issued Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA). A copy of the blanket
49 U.S.C. § 44807 COA is enclosed with this exemption. Elementary Watson must
apply for a new or amended COA if it intends to conduct operations that cannot be
conducted under the terms of the enclosed COA. If a conflict exists between the COA
and this condition, the more restrictive provision will apply. The COA will also
require Elementary Watson to request a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) not more than
72 hours in advance, but not less than 24 hours prior to each operation. Unless the
COA or other subsequently issued FAA authorization specifies an altitude restriction
lower than 200 feet above ground level (AGL), operations under this exemption may
not exceed 200 feet AGL. Altitude must be reported in feet AGL.
8. The pilot in command (PIC) must be designated before the flight and cannot transfer
their designation for the duration of the flight. In all situations, Elementary Watson
and the PIC are responsible for the safety of the operation. Elementary Watson must
ensure the PIC follows all applicable conditions and limitations as prescribed in this
exemption and ATO-issued COA and operate in accordance with the operating
documents as defined in the conditions and limitations in this exemption. The UA
must be operated within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PIC at all times. If the PIC
is unable to maintain VLOS with the UA during flight, (including if caused by the
inadvertent loss of night vision) the entire flight operation must be terminated as soon
as practicable. The PIC must be able to use human vision unaided by any device other
AFS-24-02305-E",False,WEB
FAA-2024-0545-0004_attachment_1.pdf,7,"5
than corrective lenses, as specified on the PIC’s FAA-issued airman medical
certificate.
9. The PIC may manipulate flight controls in the operation of no more than three UA at
the same time. Proposed operation of more than three UA at the same time (by one
PIC) requires a new petition or a petition to amend this exemption.
10. Unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator, the Ground Control Station (GCS)
and software must be designed for, and compatible with, the UAS to be operated. The
GCS must clearly display and identify each UAS being operated by the PIC.
11. Operations of multiple UAS by a single PIC must be automated and have a back-up
system capable of operating each UAS independently. The autopilot system must
maintain UAS separation without input from the PIC.
12. All operations may optionally utilize the services of at least one or more visual
observers (VO). If utilized, the VO must be trained in accordance with Elementary
Watson’s training program and successful completion of the training program must
be recorded. A VO (if used) shall not perform VO duties for more than one PIC at a
time. For purposes of this condition, a VO is someone: (1) who maintains effective
communication with the PIC at all times; (2) who the PIC ensures is able to see the
UA with human vision as described in Condition and Limitation No. 8; and (3) who
coordinates with the PIC to scan the airspace where the UA is operating for any
potential collision hazard and maintain awareness of the position of the UA through
direct visual observation. The PIC must ensure that the VO (if used) can perform the
duties required of the VO. All UA must be operated within VLOS of both the PIC
and VO (if used), at all times. The VO may be used to satisfy the VLOS requirement
as long as the VO always maintains VLOS capability of the UA. The VO (if used)
must maintain visual sight of all UA at all times during flight operations without
distraction, the VO must have no collateral duties, and the VO cannot act as the PIC
during the flight. The PIC and VO (if used) must be able to communicate verbally at
all times; electronic messaging or texting is not permitted during flight operations. If
an operation begins with the use of a VO, then that operation must be completed with
the use of that VO (i.e. an operation must not switch from the use of a VO to an
operation without the use of a VO mid-operation). If either the PIC or a VO (if used)
is unable to maintain VLOS with the UA during flight, (including if caused by the
inadvertent loss of night vision) the entire flight operation must be terminated as soon
as practicable.
13. If a VO is not utilized, the PIC must maintain VLOS with the UA during the entire
flight operation. Additional support personnel may be used to conduct UA
inspections, and servicing, such as changing batteries and refilling or exchanging
AFS-24-02305-E",False,WEB
FAA-2024-0545-0004_attachment_1.pdf,8,"6
hoppers. Additional support personnel are not considered to be performing the
function of a VO; however, their use is encouraged to ensure the PIC is not distracted
with non-essential duties during flight.
14. All documents needed to operate the UAS and conduct its operations in accordance
with the conditions and limitations stated in this grant of exemption, are hereinafter
referred to as the operating documents. At a minimum, the operating documents must
include:
a. Elementary Watson’s operations manual;
b. Elementary Watson’s training program;
c. The manufacturer’s provided flight manual;
d. All other manufacturer UAS provided documents;
e. This exemption; and
f. Any ATO-issued COA that applies to operations under this exemption.
These operating documents must be accessible during all UAS operations that occur
under this exemption and made available to the Administrator or any law enforcement
official upon request. If a discrepancy exists between the conditions and limitations in
this exemption and the procedures outlined in the operating documents, the
conditions and limitations herein take precedence and must be followed. Otherwise,
Elementary Watson must follow the procedures as outlined in its operating
documents.
15. Elementary Watson must have and keep current a comprehensive operations Manual
that is tailored for their proposed operation and contain, at a minimum:
a. Operations policies, methods, and procedures that address Safety Risk
Management (SRM);

o. Multi-UAS Operation (if operating Multi-UAS), the Training Program must
include:
Satisfactory pre-flight inspection of the GCS and operating area to
o
ensure that three UAS can operate and land safely.
p. Multi-UAS Operation at Night (if operating multi-UAS at night), the Training
Program must include:
Satisfactory pre-flight inspection of the GCS and operating area to
o
ensure that three UAS can operate and land safely; and
Satisfactory pre-flight checks to ensure the aircraft identification lights
o
distinguish each UAS individually.
q. Operation without a VO (if operating without a VO), the Training Program must
include:
All roles and responsibilities of the VO to be assumed and conducted
o
by the PIC.
17. Any UAS that has undergone maintenance or alterations that affect the UAS
operation or flight characteristics (e.g., replacement of a flight-critical component)
must undergo a functional test flight prior to conducting further operations under this
exemption. Functional test flights may only be conducted by a PIC with a VO (if
used) and other personnel required to conduct the functional flight test (such as a
mechanic or technician) and must remain at least 500 feet from other people. The
AFS-24-02305-E",False,WEB
FAA-2024-0545-0004_attachment_1.pdf,10,"8
functional test flight must be conducted in such a manner so as to not pose an undue
hazard to persons and property.
18. Elementary Watson is responsible for maintaining and inspecting all aircraft to be
used in the operation and ensuring that they are all in a condition for safe operation.
19. Prior to each flight, the PIC must conduct a pre-flight inspection and determine the
UAS is in a condition for safe flight. The pre-flight inspection must account for all
potential discrepancies, such as inoperable components, items, or equipment. If the
inspection reveals a condition that affects the safe operation of the UAS, the UA is
prohibited from operating until the necessary maintenance has been performed, and
the UA is found to be in a condition for safe flight.
20. Elementary Watson must follow the UAS manufacturer’s operating limitations,
maintenance instructions, service bulletins, overhaul, replacement, inspection, and
life-limit requirements for the UAS and UAS components. Each UAS operated under
this exemption must comply with all manufacturers’ safety bulletins. Maintenance
must be performed by individuals who have been trained by Elementary Watson in
proper techniques and procedures for these UAS. All maintenance must be recorded
in the UAS records including a brief description of the work performed, date of
completion, and the name of the person performing the work.
21. A PIC must hold a remote pilot certificate with a small UAS rating issued under
part 107. The PIC must meet the requirements of Section 107.65, Aeronautical
knowledge recency.
22. For night operations, the PIC must not have any night operating limitations on their
FAA-issued airman medical certificate, nor any medical condition which interferes
with night vision and must be able to perceive those colors necessary to correctly
distinguish the UA’s position and orientation at night.
23. The PIC must also hold at least a current FAA third-class airman medical certificate.
The PIC may not conduct the operation if the PIC knows or has reason to know of
any medical condition that would make the PIC unable to meet the requirements for
at least a third-class medical airman medical certificate or is taking medication or
receiving treatment for a medical condition that results in the PIC being unable to
meet the requirements for at least a third-class medical certificate. A VO (if used) or
any other direct participant shall not participate in the operation if they know or have
reason to know of any physical or mental condition that would interfere with the safe
operation of the UAS.
24. The PIC must satisfactorily complete Elementary Watson’s training program
requirements, as described in the training manual; and satisfactorily complete the
AFS-24-02305-E",False,WEB
FAA-2024-0545-0004_attachment_1.pdf,11,"9
applicable knowledge and skills requirements for agricultural aircraft operations
outlined in part 137, with the exception of Sections 137.19(e)(2)(ii), 137.19(e)(2)(iii),
and 137.19(e)(2)(v), which are not required for the purposes of meeting this
condition. Elementary Watson or chief supervisor’s knowledge and skill tests of
14 CFR § 137.19(e) may be self-administered. Documentation of satisfactory
completion of both the training program and the knowledge and skill tests of Section
137.19(e) must include the date of the test, as well as the PIC’s name, FAA pilot
certificate number, and legal signature. This documentation must be provided to the
FAA upon request.
25. PIC qualification flight hours and currency may be logged in a manner consistent
with 14 CFR § 61.51(b). However, time logged for UAS operations may not be
recorded in the same columns or categories as time accrued during manned flight, and
UAS flight time does not count toward total flight time required for any part 61
requirement.
26. When operating without a VO, the PIC will remain at the ground station at all times
while any UAS is in flight. The PIC will not leave the ground station to load or
service a UAS on the ground while any UAS is in flight. When operating without a
VO, the PIC must land all UAS before proceeding to load or service.
27. All training operations must be conducted during dedicated training sessions in
accordance with the Elementary Watson’s training program. Elementary Watson may
conduct training operations only for the Elementary Watson’s employees.
Furthermore, the PIC must operate the UA not closer than 500 feet to any
nonparticipating person while conducting training operations. Training, individually
and combined, is required for night, multiple UAS by a single PIC, and operations
without a VO.
28. The VO (if used) must not have any medical condition which interferes with night
vision and must be able to perceive those colors necessary to correctly distinguish the
UA’s position and orientation at night.
29. For night operations, the VO (if used) must have completed the night training portion
of Elementary Watson’s training program requirements, the completion of which
must be documented. This documentation must be provided to the FAA upon request.
AFS-24-02305-E",False,WEB
FAA-2024-0545-0004_attachment_1.pdf,12,"10
30. UAS operations may be conducted during night, as defined in 14 CFR § 1.1. All
operations must be conducted under visual meteorological conditions (VMC).
Operations may not be conducted under special visual flight rules (SVFR). Night
operations require anti-collision lighting that is visible for 3 statute miles and has a
flash rate sufficient to avoid a collision as is consistent with 14 CFR § 107.29(b). The
aircraft must also be equipped with continuously illuminated identification lighting.
• For multi-UAS operation at night, the UAS must incorporate unique identification
lights configured to match each UAS’s color displayed in the ground station
software.
31. For night operations, the area of operation must be sufficiently illuminated to allow
both the remote PIC and VO (if used) to identify people or obstacles on the ground,
or the PIC must have inspected the operating area in person during daylight hours in
order to assess all potential hazards and develop a plan to avoid these hazards.
32. For night operations, the PIC must verify all aircraft lights are fully functional prior to
each operation. Should the lighting system become inoperative, the night operation
must cease immediately.
33. The UA may not be operated less than 500 feet below or less than 2,000 feet
horizontally from a cloud or when visibility is less than 3 statute miles from the PIC.
34. For UAS operations where a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signal is
necessary to safely operate the aircraft, the PIC must immediately recover or land the
UA upon loss of GNSS signal.
35. An individual system failure must not interfere with the operation of other UAS or
cause incidents, accidents, or loss of control involving UAS that are the subject of this
exemption.
36. If the PIC loses command or control link, the UA must follow a pre-determined route
to either reestablish link or immediately recover or land.
37. The UAS must be equipped with a flight termination system. Prior to operations
subject to this exemption, the flight termination system must be tested and verified to
operate as described in the operating documents.
38. The PIC must abort the flight operation if unexpected circumstances or emergencies
arise that could degrade the safety of persons or property. The PIC must terminate
flight operations without causing undue hazard to persons or property in the air or on
the surface.
39. The PIC is prohibited from beginning a flight unless (considering wind and forecast
weather conditions) there is enough available power for each aircraft involved in the
AFS-24-02305-E",False,WEB
FAA-2024-0545-0004_attachment_1.pdf,13,"11
operation to conduct the intended operation with sufficient reserve such that in the
event of an emergency, the PIC can land each aircraft in a known area without posing
an undue risk to other aircraft or people and property on the surface. If the
manufacturer’s manual, specifications, or other documents that apply to the operation
of the UAS recommend a specific volume of reserve power, the PIC must adhere to
the manufacturer’s recommendation, as long as it allows the aircraft to conduct the
operation with sufficient reserve and maintain power to land the aircraft in a known
area without presenting undue risks, should an emergency arise.
40. Documents used by Elementary Watson to ensure the safe operation and flight of the
UAS and any documents required under 14 CFR §§ 91.9, 91.203, and 137.33 must be
available to the PIC at the GCS of the UAS any time any UA operates in accordance
with this exemption. These documents must be made available to the Administrator
or any law enforcement official upon request.
41. The UA must remain clear and give way to all manned aviation operations and
activities at all times.
42. The UAS may not be operated by the PIC from any moving device, vessel, or vehicle.
43. All flight operations must be conducted at least 500 feet from all persons who are not
directly participating in the operation, and from vessels, vehicles, and structures,
unless when operating:
a. Over or near people directly participating in the operation of the UAS. No person
may operate the UAS directly over a human being unless that human being is
directly participating in the operation of the UAS, to include the PIC, VO (if used)
and other personnel who are directly participating in the safe operation of the UA.
b. Near nonparticipating persons. Except as provided in subsection (a) of this
section, a UA may only be operated closer than 500 feet to a person when barriers
or structures are present that sufficiently protect that person from the UA and/or
debris or hazardous materials such as fuel or chemicals in the event of an
accident. Under these conditions, Elementary Watson must ensure that the person
remains under such protection for the duration of the operation. If a situation
arises, in which the person leaves such protection and is within 500 feet of the
UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner that does not cause
undue hazard to persons.
AFS-24-02305-E",False,WEB
FAA-2024-0545-0004_attachment_1.pdf,14,"12
c. Closer than 500 feet to vessels, vehicles and structures. The UA may be operated
closer than 500 feet, but not less than 100 feet, from vessels, vehicles, and
structures under the following conditions:
i. The UAS is equipped with an active geo-fence boundary, set no closer than
100 feet to applicable waterways, roadways, or structures;
ii. The PIC must have a minimum of 7 hours’ experience operating the
specific make and model UAS authorized under this exemption, at least
3 hours of which must be acquired within the preceding 12 calendar
months;
iii. The PIC must have a minimum of 25 hours’ experience as a PIC in
dispensing agricultural materials or chemicals from a UA;
iv. The UA may not be operated at a groundspeed exceeding 15 miles per hour;
v. The UA altitude may not exceed 20 feet AGL; and
vi. The PIC must make a safety assessment of the risk of operating closer than
500 feet from those objects and determine that it does not present an undue
hazard.
d. Closer than 100 feet from vessels, vehicles and structures. The UA may operate
closer than 100 feet from vessels, vehicles, and structures in accordance with the
conditions listed in Condition and Limitations No. 43(c)(ii) through (vi) and the
following additional conditions:
i. The UAS is equipped with an active geo-fence boundary, set to avoid the
applicable waterways, roadways, or structures; and
ii. Elementary Watson must obtain permission from a person with the legal
authority over any vessels, vehicles or structures prior to conducting
operations closer than 100 feet from those objects.
44. The PIC or a VO (if used) must be able to determine the aircraft’s altitude, attitude,
and direction of flight at all times at the GCS or have an attitude threshold limit alert
that must be operable prior to night flight operations.
45. All operations shall be conducted from and over predetermined, uninhabited,
segregated, private or controlled-access property as described in Elementary
Watson’s Flight Operations Procedures Manual. The PIC must ensure the entire
operational area will be controlled2 to reduce risk to persons and property on the
ground, as well as other users of the National Airspace System (NAS). This area of
operation will include a defined lateral and vertical area where the UA will operate
and must be geo-fenced to prevent any lateral and vertical excursions by the operating
UA. Safety procedures must be established for persons, property and applicable
airspace within the area of operation. A briefing must be conducted regarding the
planned UAS operations prior to operation at each location of operation in which
2 Elementary Watson will control access to minimize hazards to persons and property in the air and on the
ground.
AFS-24-02305-E",False,WEB
FAA-2024-0545-0004_attachment_1.pdf,15,"13
Elementary Watson has not previously conducted agricultural aircraft operations. All
personnel who will be performing duties within the boundaries of the area of
operation must be present for this briefing. Additionally, all operations conducted
under this exemption may only occur in areas of operation that have been physically
examined by Elementary Watson prior to conducting agricultural aircraft operations
and in accordance with the associated COA.
46. Any incident, accident, or flight operation that transgresses the lateral or vertical
boundaries of the operational area as defined by the applicable COA must be reported

KCE075BCT007_WEB.pdf,1,"Web Development
Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide
Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple
single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social
network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly
refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client
liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-
commerce development.
Among Web professionals, ""Web development"" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of
building Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content
management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical
skills.
For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of
people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while
developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting
developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic
designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort
between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of
Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack
developer.[3] Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user
browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since the commercialization of the
Web with Tim Berners-Lee[4] developing the World Wide Web at CERN, the industry has
boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.
Importance of Web Development
As human beings, we pride ourselves on our superb adaptation skills and ability to change with
the times. Stemming from this, when the social world shifted from a place of interpersonal
connections to internet connections, so did the world of business. There's no getting around it;
our digitally-driven lifestyle has given us little choice but to adapt to technology, and if you
haven't already, it's time to get a move on. It's a no-brainer; website development is now essential
to you as a business person. For your business to generate more business, your voice needs to be
heard, your brand needs to be seen, and your goals need to be reached. Website development is
the key to making those things happen. The same way an eye is the window to the soul, a
website is the window to the business, giving customers a taste of what you have to offer and
enticing them to delve deeper for more.
We are simple creatures in that we like convenience, and there's nothing more convenient than
accessing a whole host of information by simply clicking a button, which is what millions of",False,WEB
KCE075BCT007_WEB.pdf,2,"people do when they go online every day. If your product can't be found on the other side of that
click, you've already lost access to those millions of people, and your company effectively
doesn't exist. In conjunction with this, establishing a strong web presence as a business while
reaching millions of internet surfers who might become potential clients will elevate your
product to a universally compatible entity, even if the service you provide is physically localized
to a specific place. So what kind of information is valuable to showcase on your website, in order
to leave a maximal impact?
Front-end Development
Front end development is programming which focuses on the visual elements of a website or app
that a user will interact with (the client side). Meanwhile, back end development focuses on the
side of a website users can’t see (the server side). They work together to create a dynamic
website to allow users to make purchases, use contact forms, and any other interactive activities
you might participate in while browsing a site. Some examples of dynamic websites are Netflix,
PayPal, Facebook, and the Kenzie Academy site you’re currently on.
Back-End Development
Back-end Development refers to the server-side development. It focuses on databases, scripting,
website architecture. It contains behind-the-scene activities that occur when performing any
action on a website. It can be an account login or making a purchase from an online store. Code
written by back-end developers helps browsers to communicate with database information.
Frontend Vs. Backend
When you’re coding, you’ll use a programming language. Much like human languages, these
languages allow programmers to communicate with their computers through a series of symbols
(referred to as code). Very simply, it’s like giving your computer instructions. Front end
developers work in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It’s the standard markup language for creating
webpages.
 CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets. While HTML is used to create structure on a site, CSS
is used to bring style and flair. It defines a site’s colors, fonts, and the style of other site content.
 JavaScript is a language that can be used to make a site interactive and fun. You can use it to run
a game on your site, to name one example.
Front end also works in its own set of frameworks and libraries. Here are just a few of the
frameworks and libraries a front end developer would work with:
 AngularJS
 React.js",False,WEB
KCE075BCT007_WEB.pdf,3," jQuery
 Sass
Back end developers work in languages like PHP, C++, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and
Node.js. Here’s a bit more on a few of these languages:
 PHP is a server-side scripting language.
 Java is a highly popular platform and programming language.
 Python is a general-purpose coding language. It’s different from some of the others we’ve
mentioned here because it can be used for other kinds of software development and isn’t limited
solely to web development.
Back end frameworks include:
 Express
 Django
 Rails
 Laravel
 Spring
Framework
A web development framework is a set of resources and tools for software developers to build
and manage web applications, web services and websites.
Such a framework includes templating capabilities for presenting information within a browser,
the programming environment for scripting the flow of information and the application
programming interfaces (APIs) for accessing underlying data resources. The framework also
provides the foundations and system-level services for software developers to build a content
management system (CMS) for managing digital information on the Web. Developers can use
the framework to define the 'out-of-the-box' content management capabilities, user authentication
features, and administrative tools.
A web development framework can be built upon a pre-defined infrastructure such as the Linux,
Apache, MySQL and PHP (LAMP) stack.Once defined and implemented the core CMS features
and functions can be difficult to modify.",False,WEB

Web developent is the method or technique of deveopment of single or multiple web pages
and host them.Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet
(World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from
developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic
businesses, and social network services.Website development is the process of designing,
developing, and maintaining a website.
Essentially, the difference between web development and website design is that the designer
in website design designs the user interface of the website. Web development refers to the
building, creating, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web
publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application
that works over the internet i.e. websites.The word Web Development is made up of two
words, that is:
Web: It refers to websites, web pages or anything that works over the internet.
Development: Building the application from scratch.
